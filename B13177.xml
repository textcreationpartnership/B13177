            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas We have received Information of divers abuses and</hi> misbemeanours committed by <hi>Thomas Witherings,</hi> in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution as well of the Office of Post-master for forrain parts, as also of the Letter Office within Our own Dominions, and thereupon have been pleased to sequester the said Offices into the hands of <hi>Philip Burlamachi</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Merchant, who is to execute the same under the care and oversight of Our principall Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of State, till We shall signifie Our pleasure to the contrary, and have accordingly declared the same under Our Royall Hand and Signet, and commanded Our said Secretaries to see the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questration put in speedy execution, and to take such course that neither Our Service, nor the businesse of the Merchants, nor other Our Subjects, might thereby receive any prejudice or interruption. And whereas Our said Secretaries in pursuance of Our said command, have not onely affixed Papers upon the old Exchange, to give notice of this Our pleasure to all Our Subjects herein concerned, but have also given advice thereof as well into the parts beyond the Seas, as also into all places of Our own Dominions, to the end that the Service it self might continue in the same course wherein it was formerly, and nothing at all changed or altered therein, but onely the house where the said Offices are to be kept. But because We understand, that the said <hi>Thomas Witherings</hi> hath since caused certain Proclamations heretofore made and published by Our command concerning the said Offices, to be set up and affixed upon the said Exchange, which may be a great distraction to this Service, and may likewise raise such doubts in many of Our Subjects, as may cause them to make diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to conform themselves to this Our pleasure; We do therefore hereby supersede Our said former Proclamations concerning this businesse, or such part of them, and every of them, as may be contrary to, or different from, this Our sequestration, till We shall signifie Our pleasure to the contrary, and do straitly charge and command all Our Subjects whom it doth or may concern, to conform themselves thereunto, and to the directions given by Our said Secretaries, for the ordering and managing of the said Offices, as they tender Our pleasure, and will answer the contrary at their perils. Hereby promising and declaring, that as We will defend and save harmlesse all and every person and persons, that by conforming themselves to this Our sequestration, and the Orders thereupon given, shall contravene Our said Proclamation, or incur the penalties of them, so We shall cause all such as shall oppose or disobey this Our Royall will and pleasure, to be punished according to their demerits.</p>
